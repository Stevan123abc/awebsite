<h2>ABOUT ME:</h2>
<br>
<p>Hi, I'm Stevan, 48, overweight, Welsh, bald and living in Manchester.</p>
<br>
<p> I'm addicted to Greggs pasties, I sniff scented candles at B&M, and I visit Home Bargains at least 4 times a week.</p>
<br>
<p> I live in baggy joggers and hoodies, prefer comfort over style. Bit tricky at weddings,</p> 
<p>but at least I can do the Macarena and the Grease Megamix dances in comfort.</p>
<br>
<p>I loves a bit of Kylie, Steps and Madonna. Lana Del Rey is up there too with Tom and Shirley.</p>
<br>
<p>My forte is Human Resources and Project Management, but would love to pursue my dream career in music and script writing. 
<br>
<p>I have Aspergers and Irlen Syndrome. I couldn't just have one syndrome, I wanted 2, I'm greedy like that. </p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>ABOUT THE WEBSITE:</h2>
<br>
<p> This website is a platform to showcase my scriptwriting and song creations.</p>
<br>
<p>I will be updating content and uploads every week. Your feedback would be great.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Thank you for checking out my website, hope to see you all soon. Cheers Stevan.</p>
